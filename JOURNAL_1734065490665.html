        デバッグログ entry #347:<br><br>
        Spent three hours optimizing memory allocation when I noticed the livestream was starting... got distracted and somehow ended up rewriting the gacha probability distribution algorithm instead nyā...<br><br>
        Current status:
        - Memory leak: still present
        - Gacha rates: surprisingly more balanced
        - Browser RAM usage: unchanged
        - My focus: completely scattered
        
        Note to self: Maybe I should take a break... but the stream is so interesting... just five more minutes nyā...</p>
